# SafeTor

As we all know, how hectic doing torrenting is. We face so many ads and even mistakenly adopted a malware while doing thatðŸ˜‚.<br> So, I decided to make a scraping api which will do all those risky task only for you ðŸ˜‰ and will return you the clean and simple json array of your request data.
